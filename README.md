This is a selenium and jest starter file, intended to be used for UI Automation.

It comes with jest, typescript, selenium, chromeDriver, and gechoDriver.

The default files have a google model, base page, and a single test file.

The test uses a constructor to create a new Google object, calls a navigate function from the base page on the Google object, and then in the test, it asserts that seliunium was able to render the page.
